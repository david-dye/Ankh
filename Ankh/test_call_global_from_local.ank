//supporting truly global variables with the current framework doesn't work, since everything is treated as a function.
//however, we can test nested scope:

//returns 2 * (x + 10), but using an extra scope.
int foo(int x) {

	int z;
	z = {
		//all scoped values are hoisted to the function level. y is NOT flushed until foo returns.
		int y;
		y = x + 10;
		y;
	}
	z + y;
}

//40
foo(10);
