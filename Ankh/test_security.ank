// IMPORTANT ABOUT SECURITY

// Security labels are defined as "$XXX", where XXX are digits between 0 and 255, inclusive.

// A variable that does NOT have a $XXX identifier before its declaration will be assumed public.

// Public variables have security level 0; i.e. $0.

// It is sufficient to just use $0 and $1 to define low and high security levels
